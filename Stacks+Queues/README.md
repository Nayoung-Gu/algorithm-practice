# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

-   LIFO (Last In First Out)
-   ex. browser history

-   ❓ What should I use between arrays and linked lists to make stacks? <br/>
    : Both work fairly well. It depends on what your priorities are. (ex. continuity, flexibility, memory)

## Queues

-   FIFO (First In First Out)
-   ex. waitlist app

-   ❓ What should I use between arrays and linked lists to make queues? <br/>
    : Linked lists are much better than using arays because we don't need to shift the indexes everytime.
